* To Be Implemented: [0/10]
  1. [ ] Map Grid
  2. [ ] Working Alphabet
  3. [ ] Unify the North, East, South, West from the multiple enum right now
  4. [ ] Death condition
  5. [ ] Win Condition
  6. [ ] Enemy AI
  7. [ ] Remake the numbering
  8. [ ] Rename Grid / Block / Sprite to more descriptive name

  10. [ ] (LOW POSSIBILITIES) Rewrite some stuff to follow encapsulation better


* Ideas for Map Grid: [0/3]
  1. [ ] Randomize from a limited set of tiles with all directions are accessible
  2. [ ] Grid is generated uniquely with a path tester to check the possible path in the same grid
  3. [ ] Grid is generated uniquely with a path tester to check the possible path between multiple grid
     example: The path From North to south is blocked but a path is available by making a detour to west
