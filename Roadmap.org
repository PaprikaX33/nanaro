* Ideas for Map Grid: [0/3]
  1. [ ] Randomize from a limited set of tiles with all directions are accessible
  2. [ ] Grid is generated uniquely with a path tester to check the possible path in the same grid
  3. [ ] Grid is generated uniquely with a path tester to check the possible path between multiple grid
     example: The path From North to south is blocked but a path is available by making a detour to west
